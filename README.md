# TGS1_SMN
This repository contains the bioinformatics codes used for the RNA-Seq analysis between WT and SMN/TGS1 mutant cell lines


## Description of scripts:
- `SUPPA_DE_analysis.R`: the script that has been used for differential splicing analysis
- `Sleuth_DE_analysis_WT_vs_SMN.R`: the script for performing differential transcript analysis between WT and SMN-mutant cells
- `Sleuth_DE_analysis_WT_vs_TGS.R`: the script for performing differnetial transcript analysis between WT and TGS1-mutant cells
